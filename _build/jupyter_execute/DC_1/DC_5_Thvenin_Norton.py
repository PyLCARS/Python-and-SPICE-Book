# # Theveninâ€™s DC Equivalent Circuit

# Thevenin's Theorem (at DC), states that looking into any open port (two terminals sharing that same current) of a circuit that said open port, in the context of linear circuits. will appear as nothing more than a voltage source in series with a resistor. Where said voltage source is called the equivalent Thevenin voltage source that represents the summation of all voltages delivered to the open port. And the resistance in series of the Thevenin voltage source, the Thevenin resistance, is the resistance if all independent sources in our black box when removed. The brilliant thing about the Thevenin voltage and resistance is that the Thevenin Voltage is the open-circuit voltage and Thevenin resistance, via Nortons Theorem (the current dual to Thevenin theorem) is the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to short circuit current. Thus, giving us the hint to find the two equivalence via SPICE with ease
# 
# $$ V_{th}=V_{oc}$$
# $$ R_{th}=\dfrac{V_{oc}}{I_{sc}}$$
# 
# We can create an open circuit in SPICE in three ways. 
# 1. leave a port open, it works but is not a good idea due to stability issues that can occur 
# 2. fill in an open port with an exceptionally large resistor, if you need an open port this is the way to do it and not introduce stability issue 
# 3. An ideal current source has an infinite internal resistance even with zero current. This is why a dead battery creates an open,
# 
# So if we say then the Thevenin resistance is  
# $$ R_{th}=\dfrac{\Delta V}{ \Delta I}$$
# than  the Thevenin resistance may be found via the slop. So that the voltage at the port of the Thevenin equivalent circuit with a load is given by 
# $$V_{p}=R_{th}I_{p}+V_{th}$$ 
# And thus, we hook up a current source to the open port under test and sweep the current source to zero to find the Thevenin equivalency via linear regression.
# 
# You may be asking yourself why we didn't just use the spice Transfer function (.tf) to find the Thevenin equivalent circuit. While we can use .tf however, .tf really comes from two-port circuit representation that we will be deal with in AC circuits extensively. But without going down that rabbit hole now. One would have to use .tf for every independent source to the open port and then convert the gain from the source to figure out the Thevenin voltage equivalent looking into the port and apply superposition for each independent source. So yeah .tf has its usage as we will see but for finding the Thevenin and Norton circuit it's not practical.

# When applying the Thevenin theorem to find the DC equivalent circuit there are in general three cases given the mixture of dependent and independent sources in the circuit that is being reduced. But for our sake with SPICE, we don't care since we will always apply a 1A test current source. If the reader wishes to see how to analytically solve these three cases it is recommended to review the YT video from ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS ["Thevenin's Theorem Explained (With examples of Independent and Dependent Sources)"](https://youtu.be/8udwPc5pCoA) where are test example for using SPICE are sourced.

# ### There is a mistake in the calculation of V_th in case 1.
# When calculating the voltage above it was show that the node voltage could be found by using KVL around the loop to find the loop current. But then that current is used to find the voltage at node A via a naive use of the voltage drop around the loop coming from the 10V source on the left through the 10 Ohm resistor on the left giving an incorrect result of 5V. This is due to the fact there are two sources in the loop and thus there is also a superimposed voltage cumming from the right 20V source and right resistor to node A. When attempting to find the voltage at a node it is preferable to use KCL at that node. Thus the correct answer for the Thevenin voltage with respect to node A (treating node B as ground) is given by
# 
# $$\dfrac{A-10}{10} +\dfrac{A-20}{10}=0$$
# $$\dfrac{2A-30}{10}=0$$
# $$A=\dfrac{30}{2}=15[V]=V_{th}$$
# 

# ### Finding the Theivine Equivlint "Manually"

# ### Creating a packaged tool find Theivine Equivlint automatically
# Since one of the goals of this book is to spare on Analog Design Verification and to do so Analog design verification needs to have smart test suites. So let then let's take what we have just done and wrap it up into a single convenient tool that does all the work in three lines of code when we're done.
# 
# The process of doing this again is called abstraction, and to do abstraction we review what we did manually and then break down that process into automated usage. 
# 1. We created a circuit with an open port that is our DUT 
# 2. We added a 1A current source to said open port and generated the netlist to simulate against
# 3. We performed a DC sweep of the added current source to zero 
# 4. We reduced that data from the sweep to just what was need to find $V_{th}$ and $R_{th}$
# 5. We then feed the reduced data to `ployfit` to get $V_{th}$ and $R_{th}$
# 6. And this wasn't needed, but it nice to have, we create a graph of our data
# 
# So then our abstraction response should be: 
# 1. This is creating the data, and since at the moment we can not remove elements from a SKiDl circuit we can not abstract this. But we have to tell the user to have an open port and tell our tool what nets make up the open port 
# 2. Since we are restricting this to a linear circuit undergoing a .dc sim we can always use a 1A source. Further, since this is for 1 port DUT that the user will always have prepared and SKiDl makes it trivial to this, yeah this is going to be automated 
# 3. We will reuse the machiner of dc_ease , more on this in a bit, but since we are only sweeping this one source, yeah easy automation 
# 4. SKiDl makes finding things the nodes and elements at our DUT's test Port trivial, so yeah easy automation 
# 5. we just need to wrap this 
# 6. We don't have to add this, but it's always nicer to someone, even yourself in the future, to add nice built-in data displays
# 
# So automating this is going to be straight forward, and to make it more straight forward we are going to use OOP to create our new tool as an inherited extension of the `dc_ease` which means we don't have to invoke `dc_ease` inside our new tool and any changes made to `dc_ease` propagate down the so-called inheritance stack. That doesn't mean that inheritance guarantees that our new tool won't break if changes are made to `dc_ease`. Again this is not a book on Python programming that goes over the details of OOP and inheritance. But suffice to say it's standard code development practice, and thus we should use it here as well.

# 
# And so to measure it with SPICE we just replace a current source at the open port with a Voltage source.
# You might wonder why would anyone measure the short circuit current since sorts are typically not a good thing if not outright dangerous. Though to be fair unintentional and or uncontrolled opens are just as dangerous. The reason steams to one of the goals in this book and that is to create testbenchs for SPICE that mimic test setups in the lab. And while measuring the Thevenin in the lab is typically more preferable since we can start from an open circuit using a load then move toward shorting the open and using interpolation to then infer the actual short without having to make a real short. Certain testing, especially with batteries will conduct tests with short circuits. So why not have a Python-SPICE testbench ready to go and proven out before it's needed.

# ### Finding the Northon Equivlint "Manualy"
# So why are we gain going over the manual way when we know we're just going to create a wrapped tool. Cause first of all there is a subtle detail in that when we use a voltage source we can choose to either use the internal current or the current from the ammeter trick. For illustration purposes, we choose to do with the internal one. The second reason is to illustrate the process of abstraction. And that is trying not to rush into it. Build up a suite of test cases to then let the abstraction come.

# ### Creating a packaged tool find Norton Equivlint automatically
# This is fairly self-explanatory if you have read how the Thevenin tool was made. The one thing to note here is that we didnâ€™t do an inheritance from the Thevenin tool. The reason is that the Norton and Thevenin tools are in essence an evolutionary fork from `dc_ease`
