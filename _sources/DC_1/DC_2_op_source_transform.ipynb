    "So why is thus so pedantic? source transformations are mostly an analytic simplification tool. And while yes there is some practicality in being able to find a matching current source to a voltage source and vice versa with equivalent power from the standpoint of Thevenin and Norton's theorem. There are, however, serious limation with how the real circuits handle inputs of voltage and current differently. And frankly, from SPICEâ€™s point of view for this exercise, it doesn't care, it's going to solve regardless. So if you need a refresher on source transformations with an illustration of why there a really great analytical tool please watch ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS YT video on \"Source Transformations\" where this example is pulled from.\n"

    "Before building the circuit above a word about any current sources in SPICE. Recalling the discussion around the surefire method of measuring currents in SPICE using a 0V Liner Voltage Souce (aka the SPICE ammeter trick) in SPICE current flow is in the positive direction from a positive voltage to a negative voltage. So by convention, we draw independent and dependent sources with an arrow in the direction of how current is being added. While that means that all current sources are polarized such that the positive terminal is at the tail of the drawn current arrow and the head is the negative terminal. When you use a schematic editor with built-in SPICE it does all the terminal work in the background. But when we are indirectly working with netlist, via SKiDL, you will have to make sure you remember this. Or else this will bite you in the butt and keep costing you time till have this arrow and terminal connection for current ingrained into you."
