# # Working with SKiDl elements

# The following example, to be honest, is pedantic; but it serves to introduce the current source in SPICE which can be a real headache. It also shows how to let Python do the work of interacting with elements that we will readily make great use of down the road.
# 
# So why is thus so pedantic? source transformations are mostly an analytic simplification tool. And while yes there is some practicality in being able to find a matching current source to a voltage source and vice versa with equivalent power from the standpoint of Thevenin and Norton's theorem. There are, however, serious limation with how the real circuits handle inputs of voltage and current differently. And frankly, from SPICEâ€™s point of view for this exercise, it doesn't care, it's going to solve regardless. So if you need a refresher on source transformations with an illustration of why there a really great analytical tool please watch ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS YT video on "Source Transformations" where this example is pulled from.

# ### A very important word about current source in SPICE

# Before building the circuit above a word about any current sources in SPICE. Recalling the discussion around the surefire method of measuring currents in SPICE using a 0V Liner Voltage Souce (aka the SPICE ammeter trick) in SPICE current flow is in the positive direction from a positive voltage to a negative voltage. So by convention, we draw independent and dependent sources with an arrow in the direction of how current is being added. While that means that all current sources are polarized such that the positive terminal is at the tail of the drawn current arrow and the head is the negative terminal. When you use a schematic editor with built-in SPICE it does all the terminal work in the background. But when we are indirectly working with netlist, via SKiDL, you will have to make sure you remember this. Or else this will bite you in the butt and keep costing you time till have this arrow and terminal connection for current ingrained into you.

# ### SKiDl's Diabetic Syntax `&`, `|`

# Notice above that usage of Pythons logical AND operator & and logical OR operator | in creating the circuit. Since & and | are just operators in python we can do what is called operator extensions to them to make them act in special ways in a certain context. In SKiDls particular case the logical and (&) is a shorthand for putting two elements in series. And the logical OR (|) is shorthand for putting two elements in parral. Furthermore, these operators and parentheses sensitive, and are not polarized sensitive and so polarized elements need to have their terminals called out when using the. There called Diabetic Syntical Suger in light of their release announcement entitled ["SWEETENING SKIDL"](http://xess.com/skidl/docs/_site/blog/sweetening-skidl). Using is up to your codding style and that of your colleagues. All joking aside they are extremely useful operators to know how to use, and we will use them in this book.

# ### Crafting the transfomation tool

# We are not going into that much detial about these tool. The important thing is that we can take advante that all our elements (SKiDl part) and nets are objects in Python. And therefore have methods and attriputs that are accesable and therefore more usable then helping produce part of a line of a SPICE netlist. For instiance Voltage and Current souce store there dcvalue in `<V\I>.dc_value` where resitors store there resistince in `R.value`.This then alows us to use the elements to perform calculation outside of SPICE and even better assisit in creating new elements as we have done below.

# ## internal parameters:
# 
# ngspice (in fact most SPICE engines) elements have what are called internal parameters. Most of the setup parameters like dc_value, resistance, ect along with nitty-gritty parameters for more advanced SPICE simulations that will get too. What we are after of now are the internal values that store results of simulations as we have alluded to in the non surefire way to save internal parameters. For instance, resistors have a way of measuring the internal current flowing through them the but the caveat is that it only returns real values in ngspice, which will be an issue when doing AC simulations. But for DC simulations is a tool we should utilize. Also at the time of writing this PySPICE has a quark that internal values are not retrieved at the same time the branch currents and net voltages are. So to get both the simulation has to be run twice and the author is not sure if this is quark of ngspice or PySPICE but the author will look into it at a later time.
# 
# For now, just know internal parameters have a string calls of `<Elelement name>@[<internal paamamater>]` that is passed to a PySPICE simulation objects `.save_internal_parameters` method and then are returned in the results as the original string call to the results super dictionary.
